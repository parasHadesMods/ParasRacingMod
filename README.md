Para's Racing Mod
=================

Experimental mod for a fair and easy to understand Hades racing experience.

Goals:
 - Gameplay experience is unchanged as much as possible.
 - Player's intuitions about how rewards / god pool / etc. continue to work.
 - Player choices (eg. god's legacy vs god's pride) continue to feel relevant.
 - Make it easy for viewers to tell who is ahead and by how much.
 - Make the race feel fair.
 - Ease of use.

Non-goals:
 - Rebalance.
 - Preserve catch-up mechanics (Thanatos, sack).
 - Completely remove unpredictability.

Features:
 - Runners will experience the same sequence of combat rooms with the same enemy mix
   at the same run depth (regardless of the door they pick).
 - Runners can pick different rewards, but will still be offered the same choices later
   (until game mechanics dictate otherwise ie. if one runner has a full god pool and the
   other does not).
 - Shops, story rooms, and chaos continue to offer real choice between a combat room with
   a normal reward and free room with a special reward.
